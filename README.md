# GraphQL Demo Foxx Service with TypeScript and Apollo

This GraphQL demo service for ArangoDB 3.3 and higher is modelled after [demo-graphql](https://github.com/arangodb-foxx/demo-graphql).

The GraphQL logic is implemented with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) library.

## Installation

It is assumed that node, npm, npx and zip programs are already installed. Current building scripts are implemented with bash and only tested on Linux with node 10.9.0 and npm/npx 6.2.0

To build a zip package which could be installed as ArangoDB service, run the following commands:

``` shell
# Get the source tree
$ git clone https://github.com/ramblehead/demo-foxx-graphql-apollo-ts.git

# Install required node libraries
$ cd demo-foxx-graphql-apollo-ts
$ npm i

# Build ArangoDB service package
$ ./.project/make
```

After building is complete, the ArangoDB service package should be created at ```dist/demo-foxx-graphql-apollo-ts.zip```

To cleanup use the following command:
``` shell
$ ./.project/clean
```
